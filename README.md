# Objective: 
This project shows a deep learning based approach to detect and identify different types of blood cells and also detect the presence of malarial parasites in the blood. This algorithm takes in digitized blood smear images and then uses modified versions of YoloV2 model to identify the different objects with an overall mean average precision of 0.95.
